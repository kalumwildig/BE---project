Ensure .env files are set up when repo is pulled:

In order to do this create 2 files inside the root of this project. These files are to be called ".env.test" and ".env.development". Once these are created, inside each file the following text should be added "PGDATABASE=nc_news" for the '.env.development' file and then "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test" for the '.env.test' file. Double check that these .env files are within the .gitignore file.
